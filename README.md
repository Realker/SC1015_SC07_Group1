# University Career Analysis

SC1015 Mini-Project - Title: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 
In this project, we analyze the relevant numeric and categorical variables in the dataset "University Graduate Starting Income" taken from data.gov.sg. The dataset includes information of the starting salary and employment rate of students from 6 universities in Singapore from 2013 - 2019. We then find out from the data, whether entering a top university (NUS, NTU, SMU) does guarantee the best career prospects.

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict if a movie is good (rating above 7.2) based on its attributes?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Classification (Decision Tree)
2. Random Forest

## Conclusion
- Random forest classifier is a better technique than the classfication tree
- Random forest is able to handle large large volumes of data due to its complexity
- It is impossible to visualise all the trees when using Random Forest. Therefore,
- Classification trees is put into use as it excels in visualisation abilities
- Collaborating using GitHub

## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods and imblearn package
- Neural Networks, Keras and Tensorflow
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- API Usage
- Other packages such as tqdm, json, requests
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
