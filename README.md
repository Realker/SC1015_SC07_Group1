Our SC1015 Mini-Project - Title: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In this project, we analyze the relevant numeric and categorical variables in the dataset "University Graduate Starting Income" taken from data.gov.sg. The dataset includes information of the starting salary and employment rate of students from 6 universities in Singapore from 2013 - 2019. We then find out from the data, whether entering a top university (NUS, NTU, SMU) guarantee the best career prospects?Â¶
