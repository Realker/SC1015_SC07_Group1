# University Career Analysis

#
SC1015 Mini-Project - Title: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 
- In this project, we analyze the relevant numeric and categorical variables in the dataset "University Graduate Starting Income" taken from data.gov.sg. 
- The dataset includes information of the starting salary and employment rate of students from 6 universities in Singapore from 2013 - 2019.
-  From the dataset, we then determine whether entering a top university (NUS, NTU, SMU) does guarantee the best career prospects.

## Problem Definition
- Does entering a top university (NUS, NTU, SMU) guarantee the best career prospects? 
- Furthermore, how do STEM degree holders perform compared to their counterparts in non-STEM?‚Äù

## Models Used
1. Classification (Decision Tree)
2. Random Forest

## Conclusion/What we did we learn from this project?
- Non Top Stem students has a slightly higher gross monthly mean and a higher 75th percentile compared to Top Stem students. 
- Non Top Stem students generally enjoy a higher gross monthly mean based on the findings from the boxplot.
- Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) generally has fewer courses as compared to Non-Stem. As such, there may be a large percentage of graduates who enrolled into non-Stem as compared to Stem.
- Random forest classifier is a better technique than the classfication tree
- Random forest is able to handle large large volumes of data due to its complexity
- It is impossible to visualise all the trees when using Random Forest. Therefore,
- Classification trees is put into use as it excels in visualisation abilities
